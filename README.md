# Local Version Manager

Small CLI tool for detecting changes between two directories.  
Developed as an experiment and for personal use only, inspired by git.  

## Functionalities

- Preview the differences between the source and the output directory
- Backup of the changes, with possibility to rollback anytime
- Exclusion of specific directories and files via appsetting.json using a glob syntax

## TODO: future developments

- Given an history of backups give the possibility to rollback to any version
- UI
